class Sample
  def method1
    puts "This is Public method"
    method2    # calling private method

end

# create an object
obj = Sample.new
obj.method1

puts "\nExample-2"
# Private methods cannot be accessed,from outside the class. Only the class methods can access private members.

class Square
   # constructor method
  def initialize(w,h)
    @width, @height = w, h

  def getArea
    getWidth() * getHeight
  end

  def getWidth
    @width
  end
  def getHeight
    @height

  # private methods
  private :getWidth, :getHeight
